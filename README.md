## What Even Is This?

The Potatometer is a device that helps ADHD/ASD folks communicate their current cognitive state using the universal language of potatoes. 

Instead of struggling to articulate "my executive function has completely evaporated," you can just hold a button and get an objective potato rating:

| Potato State | Hold Time | What It Means |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 🥔 RAW       | 0-800ms   | Still functional, crisp |
| 🍲 BOILED    | 800-1600ms| A bit soft around the edges |
| 🔥 BAKED     | 1600-2400ms| Getting warm and toasty |
| 🍳 FRIED     | 2400-3200ms| Sizzling, crispy edges |
| 🥣 MASHED    | 3200-4000ms| Completely blended, no chunks |
| 💀 CHARRED   | 4000ms+   | Burnt out, send help |
